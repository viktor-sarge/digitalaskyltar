Digitala skyltar is a program for visualizing library contents. The file varberg.py can be run in three modes:

Mode 1 - recently returned books and new books
There are two views containing clickable book cover images of which the user selects one. One view displays recently returned books and the other displays new books. If a book cover image is clicked more detailed information of the corresponding book will be shown. 

Mode 2 - magazine blog
In this mode the display shows a list of blog posts about articles in different magazines. 

Mode 3 - youth department
The last mode either displays blogged books or new books in the same way as mode 1. There are also a browsable set of subjects that are used for filtering the displayed books. 

There is also a tool for creating configuration files that is started from admin.py.
